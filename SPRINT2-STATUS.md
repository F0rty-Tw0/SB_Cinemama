# Sprint 2 Status
For this sprint we were determined to try and complete every single user story,
as well as the authentication part. We did manage to complete every single user
story this time. Again one of the main challenges was having to properly establish
the relationship of the data in the database. When it came to booking a seat, we
had to think of a way to properly manage the schedule of the reservation as well
as which seat and row. We made sure to do so that a single user can reserve
multiple seats, in 1 booking.

### Get Movie Info

When you get a movie, you now get everything from the title, rating, minimum age,
rating, all the way to links with images, trailers and posters. We use authentic
websites to get this information such as YouTube for trailers.
