# Sprint 1 Status

For sprint 1, we managed to complete point 1, 2, 3 and 4. We estimated that
we were only going to confidently complete the first 2 user stories, therefore we
were quite satisfied with the result of this sprint. The main challenge that
proved to be difficult, was the proper creation of entity relationships. This
mostly came down to a lot of testing and running forth and back in the database.
Then testing if we were able to retrieve the information we wanted, what happened
when we deleted something in the database, in regard to parent-child relationships and so forth.


### Security  for roles
Especially adding a layer of security for the roles, proved to be an immense task
and was one we wanted to be able to complete, however we know we have to catch up
in sprint2, if we wish to complete this feature. We have a good idea of how we
are going to do this though and which tools we will be utilizing.
