## Purpose
This README file has the purpose of explaining where each individual member mostly participated
in the project and which sort of role the individual sought to fulfill. In the last section is
a link to the documentation of the project's functionalities. 

### F0rty-Tw0 (Artion Tofan)

I took on the role of the leader, overseeing code that other members of the group were submitting. That way, everybody 
understood what the code was doing and helped not only with the communication but with the learning process from 
members of the group who were not so confident in their code.  In a project of this magnitude, it was important to 
support one another. I guided my group towards the general architecture of the project, delegating tasks such as 
creating certain classes, implementing variables, errorhandlers etc. I also was sharing my screen a lot explaining code
that was unfamiliar to other members of the group, so that we could go through the code line by line, letting them 
tell me what I should write, and why. That way we could make sure that every member understood how the whole project
functioned, which classes were responsible for what and why we needed certain things such as DTOs or Configurations.
For example, I would make a controller for one service, then I would let the others create the rest and let them follow
my pattern. 



### Raszbanana (Nikolai Lenander)
Throughout the course of the project, I have been the person in charge of logging and writing down notes from daily
meetings, transcribing code and explaining it in detail, summing up challenges in writing certain code or database 
difficulties. 

For the programming part I was in charge of the Theater and Hall entity. Which meant I also had to make the repository,
service, controller and so on, for that entity. Later on when we realized we also needed booking for seats inside a hall
and a way to map this properly, I alongside Art helped to set up this as well. 

Overall I have been jumping around places in the code, like adding error handlers for a lot of the classes, or certain
extra functionalities. 


### Pawe0733 (Pawel Stephien)
At the beginning of the project I was responsible for creating the Movie entity. That means I was responsible for creating the repository, service and the controller as well. I was only focusing on one entity, as the complexity of this entity was high. It consisted of many different variables and was connected with other entities such as Director, Actor or Genre. It was important to create correct relationships with those entities to ensure proper functionality later on.

Later on I started working on creating the first DTO that would serve as a better way to display information in a clean and readable way. I created the Movie DTO that would allow users to see the information about the movie without unnecessary data (such as directorID).

On top of this, I also from time to time helped Nikolai with the notes from daily meetings. Overall, I have been jumping around the different parts of the code, adding more functions to the existing parts of the project and helping with brainstorming the functionalities we were supposed to implement.

### tombill143 (Tom Billington)
It was my job to create the entities for the Actor and Genre and provide all the code necessary to include entities

I also added the repositories for the Actor and Genre entities alongside their corresponding services and controllers

As there are several Genres to our movie entity, it became necessary to store the genres as an ENUM file. That way, the group had the option of adding more genres if that was required later on when uploading new movies.

As coding was developing during the second sprint, my limited coding skills began to show. This was my fault in part for not communicating better with my group regarding what needed to be coded. I was very apprehensive to begin attempting to try writing code that I was not entirely sure on how to construct without the entire project becoming inoperable.
